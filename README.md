# laravel-model-ts-type
Generate TypeScript types based on your models.

## Usage
### Installation

Install the package using composer:
```
composer require --dev scrumble-nl/laravel-model-ts-type
```
### Generating types
```
php artisan types:generate {--modelDir=} {--outputDir=} {--model=} {--noKebabCase}
```
Additional options:

|---------------------|:---------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `modelDir`          |     `app/Models`      | The root directory where the package can find all Laravel models                          |
| `outputDir`         | `resources/js/models` | The root directory for outputting the `.d.ts` files                                       |
| `namespace`         |        `false`        | The namespace of the generated Types. Use `false` if you don't prefer to have one         |
| `noKebabCase`       |        `false`        | Whether the file name should be formatted to kebab case                                   |
| `model`             |        `null`         | Choose to generate a model for a specific file. For example you can use `App\Models\User` |
| `indentationSpaces` |          `4`          | The amount of spaces used for indentation                                                 |


If you want to change the default values you can publish the config file and change it to you liking.

NOTE: Do not forget to add the directory to your typeroots in `tsconfig.json`
### What does it do?

This package takes (almost) all off Laravel's magic into account. It follows these steps for generating a Type:
1. Retrieve all fields from te database (only MySQL/MariaDB supported) and map them to default types (string, number, etc.)
2. Add relations for the Model, they will point to the related generated Type
3. Add the attribute getters for the Model
4. Check the `casts` attribute
5. Remove all fields that are in the `hidden` attribute

### Example output

```typescript
export type Company = {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    created_at: string /* Date */ | null;
    updated_at: string /* Date */ | null;
    slug: string;
    welcome_message: string | null;
    contact_information: string | null;
    main_color: string | null;
    logo_src: string | null;
    user_field: any[];
    language: any[];
    team_site: any[];
    is_api_enabled: boolean;
    kaizen_user_field: string;
    faqs?: Faq[] | null;
    users?: User[] | null;
    team_properties: TeamProperty[] | null;
    editor_images: EditorImage[] | null;
    meta_data?: any[];
};
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Add tests (in progress)
- [ ] Generate types for packagized models
- [x] Create command to generate type for 1 model
- [ ] Implement unqualified name for relation doc blocks
